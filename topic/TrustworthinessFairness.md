# ***Online ML University***: **AI & ML Resources from Top Universities**
Trustworthiness and fairness are paramount in machine learning (ML) systems. Trustworthiness ensures that the predictions and recommendations generated by ML models are reliable and accurate, instilling confidence in their use. Fairness, on the other hand, demands that ML algorithms treat all individuals and groups equitably, mitigating biases and discrimination.

To achieve trustworthiness, rigorous data collection and model validation processes are crucial. Regular audits and transparency in model development help maintain this trust. Fairness necessitates careful consideration of data biases, algorithmic biases, and the impact of ML on marginalized communities, fostering an inclusive and just technological landscape.

Incorporating these principles in ML development not only ensures ethical AI but also bolsters user confidence in the technology.
