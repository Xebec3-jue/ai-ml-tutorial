# **Computer Human Interaction (CHI) or Human Computer Interaction (HCI)**
Computer Human Interaction (CHI) or Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is all about how people interact with computers and technology. It focuses on making this interaction as smooth and intuitive as possible. This includes designing user interfaces, studying user behavior, and ensuring that technology is easy to use and understand for everyone. CHI/HCI experts aim to create interfaces that are user-friendly, efficient, and enjoyable, enhancing the overall experience of using technology. It's like making sure that when you use your computer, phone, or any other device, it feels natural and easy to do what you want to do.

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) focuses on developing systems that understand and respond to human behavior and preferences, enhancing user experiences through personalized interactions and intuitive interfaces. This synergy aims to create intelligent systems that adapt to users' needs, making technology more accessible and user-friendly.
