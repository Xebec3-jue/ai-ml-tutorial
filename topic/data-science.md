# ***Online ML University***: **AI & ML Resources from Top Universities**

Data Analysis focuses on examining and interpreting data to uncover meaningful information. It involves techniques such as data cleaning, visualization, exploration, and statistical analysis. Data analysts use tools like spreadsheets, SQL, and basic programming to analyze data sets and generate descriptive statistics and visualizations. They aim to understand trends, relationships, and anomalies within the data.

On the other hand, Data Science is a broader field that encompasses the entire data lifecycle, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, modeling, and interpretation. Data scientists utilize advanced analytical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and statistical models to derive insights from data. They often employ programming languages such as Python or R and leverage tools like Jupyter notebooks and libraries like TensorFlow or scikit-learn.
