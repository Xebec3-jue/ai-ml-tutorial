Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks specifically designed to operate on graph-structured data. Graphs consist of nodes (also known as vertices) connected by edges, representing relationships or interactions between entities. GNNs aim to leverage the structural information within the graph to perform tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph generation. GNNs operate by propagating and aggregating information across the graph using neural network layers. Each node in the graph captures information from its neighboring nodes, allowing for learning and representation of complex patterns and dependencies within the graph structure. GNNs have shown promising results in various domains, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and knowledge graph completion. For example, in social network analysis, GNNs can be used to predict user behavior, identify communities within the network, or detect fake accounts by leveraging the connectivity and interaction patterns present in the graph structure.
