# ***Online ML University***: **AI & ML Resources from Top Universities**
Unsupervised learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that allows AI systems to discover patterns and relationships within data without any explicit guidance or labeled examples. It enables the system to automatically identify hidden structures and clusters within the input data, providing valuable insights and knowledge. Unsupervised learning algorithms, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, play a key role in tasks like anomaly detection, customer segmentation, and data preprocessing. By leveraging unsupervised learning, AI systems can extract meaningful information from unstructured or unlabeled data, fostering deeper understanding and driving data-driven decision-making. üìäüîçü§ñ
