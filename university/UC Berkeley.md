# ***Online ML University***: **AI & ML Resources from Top Universities**
Machine Learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence that helps machines to learn and improve their abilities over time by using algorithms and statistical models. AI is a general field that covers many techniques, including ML, which trains machines to make decisions based on data. Computer Science provides the basic knowledge and skills needed to create AI and ML systems. Many of us don't have proper access to great learning resources, but there are some free learning resources available online from top universities of the world!

***This repository contains a curated list of top AI courses offered by renowned universities. Each course is handpicked to ensure that it covers the latest topics and technologies in the field of AI.***
